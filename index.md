**Introduction/Background**  

I think how nuanced our project is. There are so many different ways to approach misinformation and detect it.

**Dataset**

I would like to investigate the potential of Generative ai in this project. I think it will open more doors in terms of creating new context data and generating context as to why some parts of articles may be misleading.

**Methodology**

I think that I would try to research more how other people have potentially tried to quantify some factuality factors, or seek novel methods and advice in quantifying them.

**Results**

**Discussion**

**Gradio Chatbox**
